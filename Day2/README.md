cd 📅 Day 2: Components, Props, and State – The Core Building Blocks
🎯 Goal for Today:
Understand how React Native apps are structured using components

Learn about props (passing data into components)

Learn about state (managing internal data)

Build a small interactive app (like a Counter App)

📘 1. What Are Components?
A component is like a reusable block of UI. React Native apps are made by combining components.

There are 2 types:

Functional Components (most common)

Class Components (less common today)

🔀 2. Props (Inputs to Components)
Props let you pass data to components.

🔁 3. State (Internal Data)
State lets a component track and update data.

🧪 4. Mini Project: Build a Counter App
📦 Files to Create in /Day2/:
App.js → Main file (you can reuse Expo)

Optional: a components/Counter.js file

✅ Day 2 Summary:
 Learned about functional components

 Used props to pass data

 Managed state to make your app interactive

 Built and committed a Counter App
